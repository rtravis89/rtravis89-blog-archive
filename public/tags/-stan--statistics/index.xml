      <description>I attended a great short course on bayesian workflow using Stan at the New England Statistics Symposium yesterday. If you don’t know, Stan is “a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation”. You can easily interface with Stan through R (or python or a bunch of other languages). I figured it would be valuable for myself, and possibly others, to work through a few different problems in Stan and share my code.</description>
