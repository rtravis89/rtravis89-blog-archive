      <description>Previously I built a simple model to predict whether an NFL player would have an injury based only on their position. I restricted the analysis to QBs, RBs, TEs, and WRs. In this post Iâ€™d like to expand the model to include all positions except kickers and long snappers, as well as include some additional covariates such as player height and weight.</description>
