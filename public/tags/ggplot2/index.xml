      <description>Plotting and visualizing data are two of the most helpful and common activities for data analysts/scientists/whatevers. When I first started learning R, I would generate each plot individually, sometimes using a lot of copy-paste. This was fine in school, but it became much too time consuming and painful when I started working full-time.
The difficulties Iâ€™ve encountered are often of the sort where I need to generate a bunch of similar looking plots.</description>
