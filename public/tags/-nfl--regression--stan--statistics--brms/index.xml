      <description>Previously I use data from armchair analysis to build a simple model to predict whether an NFL player would have an injury based only on their position. I restricted the analysis to QBs, RBs, TEs, and WRs. In this post Iâ€™d like to expand the model to include 3 years of injury data (which is all I have), as well as include some additional covariates such as player height, weight, and age.</description>
