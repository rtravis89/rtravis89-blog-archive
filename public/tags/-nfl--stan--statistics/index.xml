      <description>Yesterday I wrote a post using Stan to fit simple one parameter models. These are boring, but helpful for learning the basics. Today, I’d like to start building a series of increasingly complicated regression models. I have data on all the injuries that occured during the 2017 NFL (American Football) season, courtesy of https://www.armchairanalysis.com/. What I’d like to do is build a model to predict whether a player will have an injury, where I’m going to define injury as being listed at game time as out, or on injured reserve (IR) at any time during the season.</description>
