      <description>October - China Mieville China Mieville is a very good science fiction writer, so I was intrigued when I saw that he wrote a book about the Russian revolution of 1917. Except for the first chapter that quickly covers the history leading up to the revolution and the final epilogue chapter, the book is organized so that each chapter represents a month starting from the overthrow of the Tsar in February to October when Lenin and the Bolsheviks take power.</description>
