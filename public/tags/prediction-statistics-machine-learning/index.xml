      <description>Anyone trying to learn how to build and assess prediction models is immediately swamped with a litany of strange sounding performance metrics. In the binary outcome case you might encounter: sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, accuracy, just to name a few. Fundamentally, all of the measures listed require the analyst to provide a category label for each element predicted. This is sometimes provided automatically with an algorithm. Or if the output of the model is a probability, a cut off is chosen and all elements below the cut off are classified one way, and all those above the other way.</description>
